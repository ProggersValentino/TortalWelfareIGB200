  - As you can the bar to your right called the "difficulty bar" goes down after
    completing these simple task
  - This bar dictates how the world around you looks and feels
  - However, due to people litering, this bar constantly goes up meaning it is up
    to you to keep this bar low
  - Now tap the profile icon again to jump back to the turtle perspective
  - I have a sneaky suspicion that mini game is going to be alot easier...
