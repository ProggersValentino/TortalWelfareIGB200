  - This is the ranger convservation
  - It was once a healthy place full of beauty...
  - Sadly it didn't stay like that for long once people found about this place, it
    was littered with everything imaginable
  - 'Scaring away our gentle creatures '
  - But now that you're here we can start making a difference!
  - Tap a ranger then tap on the trash to guide the ranger and get them to pick it
    up
